I am a PhD student at the [Graduate School of East Asian Studies](http://www.geas.fu-berlin.de/), Freie Universität Berlin, Germany. I received my MA in East Asian Studies from McGill University, Canada, and my BA in Tourism Management from Zhejiang University, China. I am an ethnographer working on contemporary Chinese religions, especially visitors to Mount Putuo (*putuoshan* 普陀山), the abode of Bodhisattva Guanyin 观音/Avalokiteśvara. I was born at Mount Putuo but grew up and completed my degree studies elsewhere, so I always reflect while researching.
